# Documentation Archive

> **Platform Rebranding Note**: This platform was formerly known as the "General Solicitation Platform". We've rebranded to "Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)" to better reflect its capabilities beyond solicitation. Package names (`com.solicitation.*`) remain unchanged for backward compatibility.

## Purpose

This directory contains historical documentation from the platform's development journey. These documents are preserved for reference but may not reflect the current state of the platform.
